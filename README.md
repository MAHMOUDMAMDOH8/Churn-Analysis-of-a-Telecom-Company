# telecom-churn analysis
Project Overview
Objective: The main goal of this project is to showcase my data analysis skills, particularly in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
Data Source: I obtained the data from Maven Analysis, ensuring that it's accurate and representative of the analysis I wanted to perform.
Data Cleaning: I used Power Query to clean and preprocess the raw data, making it suitable for analysis.
Data Transformation: Power Query was also employed to transform the data into a structured format, ready for visualization.
Visualization: I have created visualizations that provide insights and highlight key trends and patterns in the data.
Key Steps in the Project

Data Collection: Obtained data from Maven Analysis, ensuring that it is comprehensive and suitable for analysis.

Data Cleaning: Employed Power Query to clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and any inconsistencies.

Data Transformation: Utilized Power Query to transform the data into a format conducive to analysis, including aggregations and merging of data sources.

Visualization: Created interactive visualizations to present the analysis results effectively. These visualizations offer insights into the data's characteristics and trends.
